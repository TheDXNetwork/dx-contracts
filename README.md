**The DX Network is a protocol to standardise the exchange of structured data by creating domain-specific data marketplaces.**
Each marketplace is defined by a [data model](https://docs.dx.network/#data-models) specified in OWL and enables data owners and consumers to sell/buy data from each other programmatically.
The [first marketplace](https://docs.dx.network/#dx-tech-industry-model) on the DX Network allows for the exchange of structured data about technology companies, products, news, investors and investments.
